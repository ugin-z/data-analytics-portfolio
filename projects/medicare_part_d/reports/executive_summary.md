# Executive Summary

This project analyzes Medicare Part D spending patterns for 2023 using a
multi-level data mart architecture.

The analysis shows that overall spending is highly concentrated at the drug level,
while prescriber-level concentration is low at the system level.
However, within individual drugs, spending is often concentrated among a limited
number of prescribers.

A deep dive into the highest-spending drugs shows that elevated total costs are
primarily driven by very high utilization rather than high cost per claim.

These findings indicate that Medicare Part D cost drivers are largely drug-specific
and volume-driven, suggesting that targeted, drug-focused and utilization-based
interventions are likely to be more effective than broad system-wide prescriber controls.
