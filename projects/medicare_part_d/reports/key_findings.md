## Drug-Level Concentration
- The top 10 drugs account for 32.45% of total Medicare Part D spending.
- The top 50 drugs account for 60.96% of total spending, indicating a strong
  long-tail distribution.

## Prescriber × Drug Concentration
- At the system level, prescriber concentration is low.
- Within individual drugs, however, a small number of prescribers often drive
  a disproportionate share of drug-specific spending.

- The top 10 prescribers account for only 0.39% of total spending.
- The top 50 prescribers account for 1.0% of total spending, indicating no
  system-wide prescriber-level concentration.
